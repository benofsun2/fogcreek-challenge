    This is the core of the algorithm. We call 'pair' a pair of equal
    characters with no pairs of equal characters between them.

    We mantain two indices, i and j, which are pointing respectively to the
    start and the end of the current candidate pair. We also mantain a
    dictionary of the characters seen for the current i, and the first
    character pointed by i.

    In the following 'x' and 'y' are specific characters, '_' are characters
    with no repeated characters among them and '?' is an unspecified character.

    We have three cases:

      1. We have just seen a character that is equal to the first character.
         In our notation:

         x_?___x
         i k   j

         We now have two subcases:

           a) We have seen that character between i and j:

              x_x___x
              i k   j

              We found a pair, so we add (i, j) to the list of pairs. We also
              found (k, j), but we already know that the former is both wider
              and to the left of the latter. We can now advance i to k, since
              we already know that between i and j there are no repeated
              characters apart from x.

           b) We didn't:

              x_____x
              i     j

              We found a pair, so we add (i, j) to the list of pairs. But i
              could still be part of another pair as in case 1a, so we update
              the seen dictionary and we increment j.

      2. We have just seen a character that we've already seen between i and j,
         different from the first character:

         x_y___y
         i k   j

         We found a pair, so we add (k, j) to the list of pairs. We can now
         advance i to k, since we already know that between i and j there are
         no repeated characters apart from y.

      3. We have not yet found a pair of equal characters:

         x______
         i     j

         So we just add the character at j to the seen characters and we
         increment j.
